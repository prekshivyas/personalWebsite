# portfolio [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://prvyas.streamlit.app)
## Overview
Initally creating this as a portfolio website in the form of an extended resume, I came to discover the uniqueness of Streamlit as compared to typical front-end frameworks such as Angular and Bootstrap. Even though Streamlit is primarily used as a web application for dashboarding, its extensive features make it more aesthetically appealing to explore with as compared to alternatives such as Plotly and Shiny.

With the convenience of using Python as a beginner-friendly programming language, I have now decided to evolve this personal project into a time capsule - documenting key moments and achievements that I have attained. In addition, should I be successful in completing this project, I intend to provide my codes as open-source, so that other students can document their educational journey in a similar manner.

Portfolio website developed using `Python`, `SQLite`, `HTML` and `CSS` - deployed using Streamlit Cloud
